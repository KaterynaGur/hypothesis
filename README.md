Football Goals Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing goals in international football matches. The goal is to test the hypothesis: more goals are scored in women's international matches than in men's.

H₁ (alternative hypothesis): The mean number of goals in women's matches is greater than men's.

Significance level: 10%.

Tools Used

The following Python libraries used in the project:

pandas — for data manipulation and analysis

pingouin — for statistical tests and hypothesis testing
